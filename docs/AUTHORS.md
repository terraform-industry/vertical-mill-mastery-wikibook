## About This Wiki

The Vertical Mill Mastery Wiki Book was born from observing a fundamental gap
in how technical knowledge flows between communities. Hackers and machinists—
two groups with complementary skills—rarely cross paths. While hackers
document everything online, machinists traditionally pass their craft through
apprenticeships and shop floor conversations.

This creates a problem: milling wisdom lives in the minds and hands of
practitioners, transmitted through personal demonstration and verbal
instruction. When a master machinist retires, decades of accumulated tricks,
techniques, and hard-won insights risk being lost forever.

Modern wiki methodology offers a solution. By creating a collaborative,
versioned, and searchable repository, we can capture this oral tradition in a
format that both preserves and democratizes access to milling knowledge. This
book serves as a bridge—translating shop floor wisdom into documented best
practices that anyone can access, contribute to, and learn from.

At the time of this version's publication, this wiki is neither complete nor
perfect. It undoubtedly contains errors, omissions, and gaps where crucial
wisdom should be. But that's the beauty of the wiki format—it's a living
document. Every reader can become a contributor, correcting mistakes, adding
missing techniques, and expanding sections based on their own experience.
Through collective effort, this resource will grow more comprehensive and
accurate over time.

The goal is simple: ensure that the art and science of vertical milling
remains accessible to future generations, whether they come from machine
shops or makerspaces, trade schools or hackerspaces.
