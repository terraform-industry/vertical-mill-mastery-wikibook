## 🎯 Purpose

This wiki bridges the knowledge gap between traditional machinist wisdom and
modern documentation practices. By capturing shop floor expertise in an
accessible, searchable format, we ensure critical milling knowledge remains
available to future generations—whether they come from machine shops,
makerspaces, trade schools, or hackerspaces.

## 📚 Contents

The book covers 15 comprehensive chapters:

- **Fundamentals**: Machine basics, setup, and first operations
- **Basic Operations**: Milling techniques, stock preparation, and layout
- **Precision Techniques**: Feature location, cutting fluids, and measurement
- **Projects**: Hands-on T-nut making project
- **Advanced Topics**: DRO systems, fixturing, slotting, threading, and boring

## 🛠️ Development
